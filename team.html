										<h3><img src="images/nek.png" alt="Nek" style="float: left;margin-right: 1em;"/></h3><h2>Nick Steelman</h2>
										<h9>A rising E:C, Nick enjoys board games, Super Smash Bros, and Christmas music. In addition to Nick's solid contributions, his on-campus car afforded us the mobility to travel to Home Depot whenever we were in need of supplies.</h9>
										<h9>Nick's learning goals consisted of implementing software with a larger mechanical system. He was able to achieve this goal by creating the MIDI File to Mechanical Memory conversion program, as well as being a member the electrical team, tasked with creating and driving the motors.</h9>

										<br><h3><img src="images/nat.jpg" alt="Nat" style="float: right;margin-right: 1em;"/></h3><h7>Nate Sampo</h7>
										<br><br><br><h8>Nate is great at making good looking websites, but even better at putting text into blank HTML. As a unicyclist and quiz bowl competitor, Nate is easily the nerdiest person on the team. Despite playing a decent amout of Super Smash Bros, he is only capable of playing a single character.</h8>
										<h8>Nate's learning goal was to implement software and help fabricate our project. Nate achieved these goals by taking the lead on the instrument manufacturing team and website development, as well as helping laser cut and assemble the sprint deliverables.</h8>

										<br><h3><img src="images/jarm.png" alt="Jarm" style="float: left;margin-right: 1em;"/></h3><h2>Jeremy Ryan</h2>
										<h9>Jeremy is an aspiring electrical engineering and tropical fish. He loves debating, comma, etiquette, and wearing a white hat. At night, Jeremy can be found playing board games and unicycling around the lounge.</h9>
										<h9>Jeremy's learning goal was to do electrical design in the context of a mechanical system. To accomplish these goals, he applied himself to the motor and instrument team, where he lead the creation of the circuits to drive the motors, and helped produce and tune the instruments.</h9>

										<br><h3><img src="images/pal.png" alt="Pal" style="float: right;margin-right: 1em;"/></h3><h7>Paul Nadan</h7>
										<br><br><br><h8>Paul is the grayest person on the team. He likes making CAD, and loves breaking CAD. Team meetings typically consisted of a long-lasting argument between Daniel and Paul about the feasibility of turning people into chairs, followed by a lot of work very late at night.</h8>
										<h8>Paul's learning goal was to learn more about mechanical design in a complex system. As such, Paul co-lead the Mechanical Design and CAD team, and was one of the main team members responsible for manufacturing our sprint deliverables.</h8>

										<br><h3><img src="images/danny.jpg" alt="Danny" style="float: left;margin-right: 1em;"/></h3><h2>Daniel Alhadeff</h2>
										<h9>Daniel has a lot of opinions and loves to share them. He has recently discovered the wonders of printing from the internet, increasing his productivity tenfold. At night, you can find Daniel doing CAD and failing to use Git.</h9><br><br><br><br><br>
										<h9>Daniel's learning goal was to practice collaborative mechanical design. In order to accomplish this goal, Daniel co-lead the Mechanical Design and CAD team. In addition, he manufactured a large portion of our sprint deliverables to gain more fabrication experience.</h9>
